# Predicting-Stock-market-prices-

This project is an attempt to predict the U.S. S&P 500 index. Simply it is a POC on the performance of long term short term memory deep learning algorithimns. I use the historical prices of the S&P 500 index, and see the performance. Note this for now May 3, 2020 is only using prices and volume. There are more features to add along with a frontend as well.
