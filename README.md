# Research_and_design_with_deep_learning_and_Stock_price_movements

This project is an attempt to predict the U.S. S&P 500 index. Simply it is a POC on the performance of long term short term memory deep learning algorithimns. I use the historical prices of the S&P 500 index, and see the performance. Note this for now May 3, 2020 is only using prices and volume. There are more features to add along with a frontend as well.

#Long Term short term memory (LSTM)

This project is to examine what LSTMs can do to predict stock market data. As the term implies, there this deep learning method is designed to be able to model both long term and short term events.


#Research 

There are various articles, to which I will refer to later ,where they state that this deep learning model does not work. This is an exercise where I attempt to validate the results of others, as well as build a price generator with Keras.
